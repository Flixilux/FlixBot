Update 1 {
    Added basic command construct
    Added some cat and dog Api
    I dont even know why im doing this
}

Update 2 {
    Added wait (CODED THAT SHIT FROM SCRATCH. AW HELL YEAH)
    Added the possibility of a music bot. doesnt work fully yet but at least it joins a vc and pretends to play music, right?
    Added more fetchers cuz thats what the world needs
}

Update 3 {
    I dont want to live anymore
    Removed music bot bc that shit is hard af and i dont want to have a heart attack at the age of 16
    Added Reactions (Disabled for now)
    Added nsfw commands (Broken for now)
    Regained some form of motivation although not very stable
}

Update 4 {
    Oh boy this took a while
    Fixed all nsfw commands (Had to rewrite them bc discord commando is very different from normal DcJS)
    Added Purge tool (Specify from 1 to 100. Please dont try to break it. Yes it checks form perms, so dont worry about it. Hopefully)
    Reactions are still broken but will hopefully be fixed in the next update
}

Update 5 {
    Well fuck me
    Actually Fixed nsfw commands. For real this time. 
    Removed e621 and r34 because that shit is just horrible
    Kinda unified the embeds but prolly have to make it completely uniform another time
    Yes, reactions were meant to be added but i dont have an invite to WeebSh, Ask DasWolke or something (The code is there but i am not authorized to make requests)
	Sidenote - Added some console logging to see what people are doing, and what errors are happening. if i can find a good logger i will implement it for statistics and make them public (just what commands are being used and how often, no guild, channel or usernames will be made public)
}

Update 6 {
    Hey! There it is! The Update with actually useful features!
	Added a Kick Feature!
	Added a Ban Feature! (So far this is a permban with no reason given. Will change in the next update)
	Added a Mute Feature! (Requires a Roll called "Muted" to be made wich lacks permission to talk)
    Added a Time Command! I dunno why you would want this but i guess its kinda neat. I also required this for timestamps

    Transparency: The above actions (Mute, Kick, Ban, Purge) are being logged to a file. Attempts at these commands which fail at permcheck or giving arguments are ALSO being logged to file.
    All other commands and command attempts are only logged to the console so I can actually see the bot working
    Noone besides me has access to these logs and that won´t change. ever.
    Things that are being logged: 
    -The Tag of the person executing the command
    -The ID of the person being Muted/Kicked/Banned (for how long and what reason) or the amount of messages deleted
    -Name of the server where its taking place (No invites are being logged. if you want me to join your server you´ll have to dm me i guess) 
    -If and why it failed
    -Timestamp   
}

Update 7 {
    Why do I even lie to myself anymore.
    Addded the reddit command group! You can now lookup posts in the following Subreddits: YouShouldKnow, Aww, EarthPorn, LifeProTips. 
    (Of course all nicely embedded to look pretty. As if they were snuggled up in blankets lying in bed :3 )
    Added the mal command! Let´s you search anime and characters on mal. Also nicely embedded
